# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis using Power BI

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze heart disease data to uncover patterns related to patient demographics, symptoms, and indicators. The dashboard was created using Power BI, offering a comprehensive visualization of key metrics associated with heart disease diagnostics.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this analysis includes various patient attributes such as age, gender, symptoms (like chest pain), and clinical indicators including cholesterol levels and maximum heart rate. The data provides insights into how these factors interrelate in relation to heart disease occurrences.

## Key Visualizations

### 1. **Sum of Age by Gender**
- **Visualization:** Pie Chart
- **Insight:** This visualization highlights the distribution of patients by age and gender, enabling us to identify the demographic most affected by heart disease.

### 2. **Sum of Chest Pain Types**
- **Visualization:** Bar Chart
- **Insight:** This bar chart illustrates the prevalence of various types of chest pain reported by patients. It highlights non-anginal pain as the most common symptom among the patient population.

### 3. **Sum of Cholesterol Levels, Trestbps, and Thalach by Gender**
- **Visualization:** Line Graph
- **Insight:** This graph tracks the average values of cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure (trestbps), and maximum heart rate (thalach) by gender. It indicates how these metrics differ across genders over varying ages.

### 4. **Sum of Age vs. Chest Pain Type**
- **Visualization:** Scatter Plot
- **Insight:** This plot examines the relationship between age and the type of chest pain, revealing how certain pain classifications may occur more frequently in specific age groups.

### 5. **Gender Distribution**
- **Visualization:** Doughnut Chart
- **Insight:** This visualization effectively shows the gender distribution within the dataset, allowing quick identification of the population most affected by heart disease.

### 6. **Overall Statistics**
- **Key Metrics:** 
  - **Total Patient Count:** 54.43 average age
  - **Gender Ratio:** Breakdown of male to female patients.
- **Insight:** These statistics provide a quick overview of the overall patient demographics and health status.

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard serves as a robust tool for visualizing critical data on heart disease diagnostics. By identifying trends and patterns in demographics, symptoms, and clinical indicators, healthcare professionals can better understand heart disease's impact on different population segments. Future work may involve a deeper analysis into predictive modeling based on this data.
